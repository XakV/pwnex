##PWNEX COMM CLIENT OVERVIEW##
- Basic communication hub built with Python
- Functions as a mail client, calendar, task-minder, and info corpus
- Uses existing modules combined with systemd timer functionality
- Builds on IMAP clients (maybe) for pulling down mail
- Does not support ICAL, WEBDAV, or other BS I don't know about
- Can parse emails from web calendars and create libnotify reminders
- All text files
- Creates sub-directories on the fly based on word cloud thing
- Uses symlinks for tasks or calendar event sub-directories
- Converts everything to Unix time to make it easier to deal with
- Calls $EDITOR for whatever to operate on body, header, address test
- CRUD, what do I do about Address books and GPG Keys?
- Side note check out keybase.io maybe
- Maybe has an IRC bot that looks for mentions/DMs
- Does it display markdown somehow?
- Does it set up RSS
- Will it ever work with a Database?
